# bendy_bone_handles
Blender add-on to add a new bendy bone object with handles. Several these have been made, most don't work with 2.8 any more. This one does. It adds a bendy bone as a new object in the same way you would add an armature. Support coming soon for being able to add handled bendy bones into existing armatures in edit mode. For now just arrange them and join them in as you go. Tested with 2.80 and 2.81.
